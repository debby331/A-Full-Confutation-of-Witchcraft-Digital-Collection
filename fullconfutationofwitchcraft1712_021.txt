liv’d in that Course of Life above 16

and Imprecations, on which the Devil
took Advantage over her.

With Submission to this Reverend Di-
vine, I think that all the Questions are ve-
ry superficial, and ensnaring, and half of them such as she knew not the meaning
of. As to the first, Whether she was a
Witch, she is said to confess her self to
be so: Whereas, if his second Question
had been, What is a Witch? she would
not have been able to tell; and I question
whether it might not have put his Re-
verence to some trouble to define: The
Parish having lodg’d that Name over
her for some Years, the poor simple Crea-
ture own’d her self to be what they had
stigmatiz’d her for, without either know-
ing the Hazard of Confession, or the
Properties of a Witch. The second Ques-
tion is as unfair as the first: For she
not being supposed to know the Mean-
ing of a Witch in the Latitude, her
Accusers took it, so by that second Ques-

tion
