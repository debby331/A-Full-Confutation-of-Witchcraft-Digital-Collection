the Mid summer-Night’s Dreams, and
do deny it to be in the Power of
any Person, the World calls a Witch,
or Familiar, to force any Person against
their Wills upon such trifling Errands;
or to act so upon them, as to make
them leap Five-Bar-Gates, &c. As to
the First, If it be said that a Demon,
Witch, or Spirit, forces any Creature to
act in such and such a manner, I de-
mand in the next place, how he forces
him? Does he absolutely deprive him
of the Liberty of doing what he pleases?
How came he by this Power? Has he
it from himself, or from some Superi-
or Being? I believe few are so san-
guine to affirm, that he has of himself
the Power of forcing Men to do what-
ever he pleases, without their being able
to avoid submitting to his Decrees.
If it be urg’d, that he holds this Po-
wer of the Supreme Being, what Proof
can be produc’d of it? Whatever Ar-
guments can be form’d to prove this,
Can it possibly suit with the Divine
