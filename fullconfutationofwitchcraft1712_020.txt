new’d his Proof of Jane Wenham’s Guilt,
by her not repeating a particular Sen-
tence or two in the Lord’s-Prayer; af-
ter his Dialect (which I have already
shewn to be inconclusive) asks her, if she
had any hand in bewitching Anne Thorn;
to which at first she gave no positive An-
swer; but upon Mr. Strut’s telling her
how beneficial such a Confession would
be to her own Soul, and others, if she
was guilty, she began to relent, and in
the Presence of Mr. Gardiner, and her
Kinsman Archer, Mr. Strut ask’d her sin-
cerely to tell him whether she was a
Witch? she said she was: Then he
ask’d her, whether she had not an hand
in bewitching Anne Thorn? she said she
had, but there was another concern’d
with her; Then he ask’d what induc’d
her to it? she said, the Girl had once
vex’d her. Then she was ask’d, whether
she did not meet Anne Thorn on Tuesday
Morning? To which she answer’d, No:
But being ask’d, whether it was not her
Familiar? she answer’d in the affirma-

tive.
