        Metadata is a critical tool to digital humanities studies to enable greater classification of works as they 
        are transferred to online platforms. For my work, “A full confutation of witchcraft”, it was difficult to pick 
        specific metadata that could differentiate the text. The style of each pages was nearly identical: black text, 
        yellowish pages, and similar printing styles. I needed to start with important and broad metadata such as the 
        file name (for clarification) and its corresponding page number in the text as the book’s digital copies were 
        in interesting orders with some pages skipped or even repeated. I also felt the need to note details of the page 
        that are lost in a digital copy such as dimensions (of height and width) as well as color (in the event the scanner 
        could only scan black and white images) of both the text and the page. I also wanted a way to differentiate the near 
        identical pages from a visual sense without having to read every word. I struggled to find categories to encompass 
        these visual differences on such similar looking pages but ultimately chose to use the presence/absence of italics 
        and additionally any visual imperfections (broken into the categories of scratches, smudges, dots and low ink 
        appearances). Ultimately, the metadata enables the documents to be viewed from a more descriptive perspective 
        and categorized among the twenty five page collection.
