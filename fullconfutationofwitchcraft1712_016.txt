low Labourer Mrs. Gardiner, against a
poor ignorant Old Woman. Impar
congressus: And great Stress is laid up-
on her repeating, Lead us not into Tem-
ptation, with two Negatives. Now I
would venture a small Wager upon it,
take England round, and there are 3
Parts in 4 of the Country People
pronounce that Sentence generally af-
ter this manner. But not putting this
infallible Touch-stone upon so uncertain
an Issue, as coming from the Mouth of
a Reverend Divine; It may be worth
the while to enquire, whether too ma-
ny of the Auditors were not very cu-
rious in watching every Lapse of her
Tongue, or preventing her Repetition
of those Words, with too many imper-
tinent Questions, or alarming her with
the suppos’d Impossibility of repeating
them. But drawing off from Conje-
ctures, I would fain know how the
false Pronunciation of that Sentence
particularly, came to be the Criterion
of a Witch; I think none of our Ru-
bricks enjoin it as a specifick Trial, and
I hope, no learned Divine has borrow’d
it either from a Popish Legend, or found
it amongst some Country Receipts for
a Strain, a Quaking-Pudding, or a Cut-

Finger:
